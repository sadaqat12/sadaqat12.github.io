				<h3>Distribution of Durations</h3>
				<p>This graph displays how each pass type has a difference in
					the times the customers are likely to use the bike for. Customers
					who just walk up to a bike without a pass, are likely to use it for
					longer than say someone in the staff might use it for. This is
					likely because walk-up customers likely don't need a bike on a
					daily basis and just use it occasionally when they need to go
					farther. While staff would likely just move the bikes in between
					stations. Furthermore, we can see that Flex-Pass clients are likely
					to use the bikes for a much shorter amount of time than a monthly
					pass user. We can assume from the data that the monthly pass user's
					are the heaviest regular users of the bikes.</p>

				<h3>Distribution of Pass Types</h3>
				<p>From this bar graph we can further support our previous claim that 
				monthly users are the heaviest regular users of the bikes. This can be seen in 
				the chart as there are 81,304 monthly users compared to 41,224 walk-up, 
				9,517 flex-pass, and 382 staff clients. I was able to calculate the exact number 
				of clients in each category using an R algorithm. This answers the 4th challenge question, 
				which asks how many customers include bike sharing as a regular part of their commute. For
				this all we need to do is add the number of clients for each pass category excluding
				walk-ups. The resulting answer is 91,203 regular customers. </p>

				<h3>Usage Across Months</h3>
				<p>A visual in which it is seen how the bike rentals are
					affected by the time of the year it is. As can be seen, the summer is a 
					lot busier than the winter, which is reasonable as there are likely more tourists
					in the summer time, and generally more bike friendly temperatures. While in the winter
					it gets colder, with fewer tourists so the usage of the bikes decreases. The peak time in terms of 
					ridership appears to be in August with about 24,000 riders, as compared to the slowest
					month of February in which only about 11,500 clients ride the bikes. This also answers
					the first bonus question as to how the ridership changes across seasons.</p>
